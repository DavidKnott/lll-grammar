# LLL grammar

This is an attempt at specifying the grammar and semantics of LLL. The [work in progress grammar is here](./grammar.txt).

There are a few LLL implementations, which more or less agree on the grammar:
- [Solidity's LLL](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity)
- [Serpent's LLL](https://github.com/ethereum/serpent)
- [Viper's LLL](https://github.com/ethereum/viper)
